# 2048

2048 is a single-player sliding tile puzzle video game created by Gabriele Cirulli on 2014 and published on [github](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub).
The objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine or merge them to create a tile with the number 2048.

2048 is played on a plain 4Ã—4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide when a player moves them using the four arrow keys. Every turn, a new tile randomly appears in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4
